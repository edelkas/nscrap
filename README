Scrapes scores from the N v1.4 server into a MySQL database. Each score contains
the replay id, the actual score in frames (at 40 fps), the player id pointing
to a table of players, the episode number, the level number, and the demo (5
ones in the case of episodes).


NOTE: For the purpose of compression, the demo code is transformed in a way
      that exploits their structure to obtain an almost tenfold compression.
      To recover the original demos read the following details.

      Structure of a demo: The frame count, followed by a colon, followed by a
      series of numbers separated by vertical bars. Each number encodes 7
      frames, and on each frame any combination of the 4 possible inputs can
      take place (left, right, jump, or hold), with the exception that jump and
      hold cannot occur simultaneously. Therefore, there are 12 possible
      combinations for each frame and thus 12^7 = 16M different frame codes.

      To compress the demo we transform this code into a string with each
      character representing a frame input, with only 12 possible different
      values. Because of the nature of a demo this is not random and is in fact
      highly compressible, so we deflate it using Zlib, and then to obtain an
      ASCII representation we encode it in Base64.

      To see the details of how to encode and decode each demo chunk into the
      string of inputs for each frame, see the functions "demo_encode" and
      "demo_decode" on the source code.
