* Remove hackers from the database to obtain the final dump.
* Add 2 ignore lists:
  - One for hackers, whose scores won't even be added to the database.
  - One for cheaters, whose scores will be added to the database, but they
    won't be included in any analysis function (like rankings).
* Add 'scores without demos' to 'diagnose', maybe fix'em?
* Add stats function with total number of scores, players, etc.
* Add game stats function with tls, tes, etc.
* Implement methods to analyze the data (rankings, etc).
* Fill in the rank field for better future computation.
* To verify demo compression, we could compare every demo against
  the decoding of the encoding of the demo, and raise an exception
  if not equal. It would probably not bottleneck the program.
* Separate models from the database setup, it makes no sense that
  the former is in the database setup section.
