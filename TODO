* Experiment with other compression algos (e.g. BWT from bzip2,
  LZMA from 7zip, etc). Compare not only the compression ratio,
  but also benchmark to ensure it doesn't bottleneck the program.
  To benchmark, do it both separately first, and then within the
  program (say, by parsing 10k scores and seeing the time).
* Implement methods to analyze the data (rankings, etc).
* Fill in the rank field for better future computation.
* To verify demo compression, we could compare every demo against
  the decoding of the encoding of the demo, and raise an exception
  if not equal. It would probably not bottleneck the program.
* Separate models from the database setup, it makes no sense that
  the former is in the database setup section.
* We need to sort ties based on date/id (can we?).
