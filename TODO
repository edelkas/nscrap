* There will necessarily be incorrectly downloaded scores, which will have some
  NULL values. Implement a method called "diagnose" to seek for these dubious scores
  and another one named "patch" to seek for redownload them to fix them.
    Other things to sanitize:
      - Scores without demos, check those.
      - IDs without score, maybe a new function called "recheck".
      - Make a function to show some stats, like total number of scores, demos, scores
        without demos, etc, to diagnose.
* Add ignore list.
* Implement methods to analyze the data (rankings, etc).
* Fill in the rank field for better future computation.
* To verify demo compression, we could compare every demo against
  the decoding of the encoding of the demo, and raise an exception
  if not equal. It would probably not bottleneck the program.
* Separate models from the database setup, it makes no sense that
  the former is in the database setup section.
