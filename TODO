* Create "score_id" field 
* Make compressing an option with a variable.
* Implement episodes.
* Implement methods to analyze the data (rankings, etc).
* Separate models from the database setup, it makes no sense that
  the former is in the database setup section.
* We need to sort ties based on date/id (can we?).
